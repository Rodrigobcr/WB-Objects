WB Objects framework
================================

WB Objects Framework is an ABAP framework. WB stands for Workbench so this framework mainly encapsulates ABAP repository objects (Classes, Interfaces, Packages, Reports, Includes etc) into classes that can be used across any project which needs this information (ABAP2yUML,SAPLink or similars, ABAPDoc, etc). Moreover, this framework comes with useful classes to handle frequently used logic with workbench objects such as search functionality.
